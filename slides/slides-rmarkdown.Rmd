class: inverse

## Your Turn

Do the following:

1. Change the default data frame printing method to use kable

1. Choose one of the table packages and make an attractive table that shows the top 10 districts with the highest percentage of Hispanic/Latino students (hint: use the `slice_max()` function to get the top 10 and the `fmt_percent()` function if you're using `gt` or the `percent()` function otherwise to display the percentage of Hispanic/Latino students in each)

# Inline R Code

## Inline R code

```{r eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
california_german_speakers <- read_rds("../data/french_and_german_speakers_2019.rds") %>% 
  filter(state == "California") %>% 
  pull(german_speakers)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
california_german_speakers <- read_rds("data/french_and_german_speakers_2019.rds") %>% 
  filter(state == "California") %>% 
  pull(german_speakers)
```

These two bits of text look identical, right?

In 2019, there were 854 German speakers in California.
